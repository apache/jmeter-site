This section describes the different parts of a test plan.
</p>
                
                <p>
A minimal test will consist of the Test Plan, a Thread Group and one or more Samplers.

                        The Test Plan object has a checkbox called "<span class="code">Functional Testing</span>".  If selected, it
will cause JMeter to record the data returned from the server for each sample.  If you have
selected a file in your test listeners, this data will be written to file.  This can be useful if
you are doing a small run to ensure that JMeter is configured correctly, and that your server
is returning the expected results.  The consequence is that the file will grow huge quickly, and
JMeter's performance will suffer.  This option should be off if you are doing stress-testing (it
is off by default).  
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>If you are not recording the data to file, this option makes no difference.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        You can also use the <span class="code">Configuration</span> button on a listener to decide what fields to save.

                    <p>
                        Thread group elements are the beginning points of any test plan.
All controllers and samplers must be under a thread group.
Other elements, e.g. Listeners, may be placed directly under the test plan,
in which case they will apply to all the thread groups.
As the name implies, the thread group
element controls the number of threads JMeter will use to execute your test.  The
controls for a thread group allow you to:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Set the number of threads</li>
                            
                            <li>Set the ramp-up period</li>
                            
                            <li>Set the number of times to execute the test</li>
                            
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Each thread will execute the test plan in its entirety and completely independently
of other test threads.  Multiple threads are used to simulate concurrent connections
to your server application.</p>
                    
                    <p>The ramp-up period tells JMeter how long to take to "ramp-up" to the full number of
threads chosen.  If 10 threads are used, and the ramp-up period is 100 seconds, then
JMeter will take 100 seconds to get all 10 threads up and running.  Each thread will
start 10 (100/10) seconds after the previous thread was begun.  If there are 30 threads
and a ramp-up period of 120 seconds, then each successive thread will be delayed by 4 seconds.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ramp-up needs to be long enough to avoid too large a work-load at the start
of a test, and short enough that the last threads start running before
the first ones finish (unless one wants that to happen).
</p>
                    
                    <p>
Start with Ramp-up = number of threads and adjust up or down as needed.
</p>
                    
                    <p>By default, the thread group is configured to loop once through its elements.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Thread Group also allows to specify <b>Thread lifetime</b>.
    Click the checkbox at the bottom of the Thread Group panel to enable/disable extra fields
     in which you can enter the duration of test and the startup delay
     You can configure <span class="code">Duration (seconds)</span> and <span class="code">Startup Delay (seconds)</span> to control
     the duration of each thread group and the after how much seconds it starts.
     When the test is started, JMeter will wait <span class="code">Startup Delay (seconds)</span> before starting the Threads
     of the Thread Group and run for the configured <span class="code">Duration (seconds)</span> time.

                    </p>

                    <p>
JMeter has two types of Controllers: Samplers and Logical Controllers.
These drive the processing of a test.
</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Samplers tell JMeter to send requests to a server. For
example, add an HTTP Request Sampler if you want JMeter
to send an HTTP request.  You can also customize a request by adding one
or more Configuration Elements to a Sampler.  For more

Samplers tell JMeter to send requests to a server and wait for a response.
They are processed in the order they appear in the tree.
Controllers can be used to modify the number of repetitions of a sampler.

                        JMeter samplers include:

                        </ul>
                        Each sampler has several properties you can set.
You can further customize a sampler by adding one or more Configuration Elements to the Test Plan.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>If you are going to send multiple requests of the same type (for example,
HTTP Request) to the same server, consider using a Defaults Configuration
Element. Each controller has one or more Defaults elements (see below). </p>
                    
                    <p>Remember to add a Listener to your test plan to view and/or store the
results of your requests to disk.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        If you are interested in having JMeter perform basic validation on
the response of your request, add an <a href="#assertions">Assertion</a> to
the sampler.  For example, in stress testing a web application, the server
may return a successful "HTTP Response" code, but the page may have errors on it or
may be missing sections. You could add assertions to check for certain HTML tags,
common error strings, and so on. JMeter lets you create these assertions using regular
expressions.

                    <p>
                        The first thing about this test is that the login request will be executed only
the first time through.  Subsequent iterations will skip it.  This is due to the
effects of the <a href="../usermanual/component_reference.html#Once_Only_Controller">Once Only Controller</a>.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>After the login, the next Sampler loads the search page (imagine a
web application where the user logs in, and then goes to a search page to do a search).  This
is just a simple request, not filtered through any Logic Controller.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        After loading the search page, we want to do a search.  Actually, we want to do
two different searches.  However, we want to re-load the search page itself between
each search.  We could do this by having 4 simple HTTP request elements (load search,
search "A", load search, search "B").  Instead, we use the <a href="../usermanual/component_reference.html#Interleave_Controller">Interleave Controller</a> which passes on one child request each time through the test.  It keeps the
ordering (i.e. it doesn't pass one on at random, but "remembers" its place) of its
child elements.  Interleaving 2 child requests may be overkill, but there could easily have
been 8, or 20 child requests.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Note the <a href="../usermanual/component_reference.html#HTTP_Request_Defaults">HTTP Request Defaults</a> that
belongs to the Interleave Controller.  Imagine that "Search A" and "Search B" share
the same PATH info (an HTTP request specification includes domain, port, method, protocol,
path, and arguments, plus other optional items).  This makes sense - both are search requests,
 hitting the same back-end search engine (a servlet or cgi-script, let's say).  Rather than
 configure both HTTP Samplers with the same information in their PATH field, we
 can abstract that information out to a single Configuration Element.  When the Interleave
 Controller "passes on" requests from "Search A" or "Search B", it will fill in the blanks with
 values from the HTTP default request Configuration Element.  So, we leave the PATH field
 blank for those requests, and put that information into the Configuration Element.  In this
case, this is a minor benefit at best, but it demonstrates the feature.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>The next element in the tree is another HTTP default request, this time added to the
Thread Group itself.  The Thread Group has a built-in Logic Controller, and thus, it uses
this Configuration Element exactly as described above.  It fills in the blanks of any
Request that passes through.  It is extremely useful in web testing to leave the DOMAIN
field blank in all your HTTP Sampler elements, and instead, put that information
into an HTTP default request element, added to the Thread Group.  By doing so, you can
test your application on a different server simply by changing one field in your Test Plan.
Otherwise, you'd have to edit each and every Sampler.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The last element is a <a href="../usermanual/component_reference.html#HTTP_Cookie_Manager">HTTP Cookie Manager</a>.  A Cookie Manager should be added to all web tests - otherwise JMeter will
ignore cookies.  By adding it at the Thread Group level, we ensure that all HTTP requests
will share the same cookies.

will then check that the text is present in the HTTP response.  If JMeter cannot find the
text, then it will mark this as a failed request.

                        A configuration element works closely with a Sampler.  Although it does not send requests
(except for <a href="../usermanual/component_reference.html#HTTP(S)_Test_Script_Recorder">HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder</a>), it can add to or modify requests.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>A configuration element is accessible from only inside the tree branch where you place the element.
For example, if you place an HTTP Cookie Manager inside a Simple Logic Controller, the Cookie Manager will
only be accessible to HTTP Request Controllers you place inside the Simple Logic Controller (see figure 1).
The Cookie Manager is accessible to the HTTP requests "Web Page 1" and "Web Page 2", but not "Web Page 3".  </p>
                    
                    <p>Also, a configuration element inside a tree branch has higher precedence than the same element in a "parent"
branch.  For example, we defined two HTTP Request Defaults elements, "Web Defaults 1" and "Web Defaults 2".
Since we placed "Web Defaults 1" inside a Loop Controller, only "Web Page 2" can access it.  The other HTTP
requests will use "Web Defaults 2", since we placed it in the Thread Group (the "parent" of all other branches).</p>

The JMeter test tree contains elements that are both hierarchical and ordered.  Some elements in the test trees are strictly hierarchical (Listeners, Config Elements, Post-Processors, Pre-Processors, Assertions, Timers), and some are primarily ordered (controllers, samplers).  When you create your test plan, you will create an ordered list of sample request (via Samplers) that represent a set of steps to be executed.  These requests are often organized within controllers that are also ordered.  Given the following test tree:</p>

                    <p>The order of requests will be, One, Two, Three, Four.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Some controllers affect the order of their subelements, and you can read about these specific controllers in <a href="component_reference.html">the component reference</a>.

                    <p>Other elements are hierarchical.  An Assertion, for instance, is hierarchical in the test tree.
If its parent is a request, then it is applied to that request. If its
parent is a Controller, then it affects all requests that are descendants of
that Controller.  In the following test tree:</p>

                    <p>Another example, this time using Timers:</p>
                    
                    <figure>

                    <p>In this example, the requests are named to reflect the order in which they will be executed.  Timer #1 will apply to Requests Two, Three, and Four (notice how order is irrelevant for hierarchical elements).  Assertion #1 will apply only to Request Three.  Timer #2 will affect all the requests.</p>
                    
                    <p>Hopefully these examples make it clear how configuration (hierarchical) elements are applied.  If you imagine each Request being passed up the tree branches, to its parent, then to its parent's parent, etc., and each time collecting all the configuration elements of that parent, then you will see how it works.  </p>

Variables don't have to vary - they can be defined once, and if left alone, will not change value.
So you can use them as short-hand for expressions that appear frequently in a test plan.
Or for items which are constant during a run, but which may vary between runs.
For example, the name of a host, or the number of threads in a thread group.
</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        When deciding how to structure a Test Plan,
make a note of which items are constant for the run, but which may change between runs.
Decide on some variable names for these -
perhaps use a naming convention such as prefixing them with <span class="code">C_</span> or <span class="code">K_</span> or using uppercase only
to distinguish them from variables that need to change during the test.
Also consider which items need to be local to a thread -
for example counters or values extracted with the Regular Expression Post-Processor.
You may wish to use a different naming convention for these.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        For example, you might define the following on the Test Plan:

                        <pre>
HOST             www.example.com
THREADS          10
LOOPS            20
</pre>
                        You can refer to these in the test plan as <span class="code">${HOST}</span> <span class="code">${THREADS}</span> etc.
If you later want to change the host, just change the value of the <span class="code">HOST</span> variable.
This works fine for small numbers of tests, but becomes tedious when testing lots of different combinations.
One solution is to use a property to define the value of the variables, for example:

                        <pre>
HOST             ${__P(host,www.example.com)}
THREADS          ${__P(threads,10)}
LOOPS            ${__P(loops,20)}
</pre>
                        You can then change some or all of the values on the command-line as follows:

                        <pre>
jmeter &hellip; -Jhost=www3.example.org -Jloops=13
</pre>
                        
                    </p>
